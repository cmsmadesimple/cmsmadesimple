# Contributing to CMS Made Simple

Thank you for your interest in contributing to CMS Made Simple (CMSMS ðŸ¤¯)!  
We welcome contributions from the community to help make our content management system even better.
This page describes how to maintain a copy of CMSMS for development purposes.  
>This is the way ...
## Code of Conduct

By participating in the CMSMS community, you agree to abide by our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). 


## The repository
This our official repository : [https://github.com/cmsmadesimple/cmsmadesimple](https://github.com/cmsmadesimple/cmsmadesimple)  
As of the reading of this document, the latest version is ![latest](https://badgen.net/github/release/cmsmadesimple/cmsmadesimple)


## Forking the repository
Use Github to fork the repository, as per [this guide](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo).  
As a general guideline, forking is mandatory and will allow you to work on your own copy of the repository while still being able to contribute to the main repository.

## Development Setup
For the moment, the development setup is done in two steps: 
1. Setup CMS Made Simple as a regular installation (English only, check [releases](https://github.com/cmsmadesimple/cmsmadesimple/releases)), save the config.php file and remove all other files/directories
2. Clone the repository, paste your saved [config.php](#setup-config.php) file in the root of the repository
  
Following these steps, you should have a running CMS Made Simple installation in a working directory (usually named cmsmadesimple).
You can now start to load your modules and custom assests to fit your needs.

## Reporting Bugs

Before submitting a bug report:
- Check the [Forum](https://forum.cmsmadesimple.org) to see if the issue has been discussed
- Verify the bug exists in the latest stable version of CMSMS ![latest](https://badgen.net/github/release/cmsmadesimple/cmsmadesimple) 
- Check the [Forge](https://dev.cmsmadesimple.org/bug/list/6) for existing issues

When submitting a bug report, please include:
- Your CMSMS version
- PHP version and server environment details
- MySQL/MariaDB version
- A clear description of the steps to reproduce
- Any relevant error messages or logs
- Any modifications or custom modules installed

### How to create a Bug Report fixing Branch
Bug Report branches are usually created from the `master` branch. The feature will be included in a future/next release.
Your branch should be named `BR-45678` where `45678` is the number of the feature request in the [Forge](https://dev.cmsmadesimple.org/bug/list/6).

```git
$ cd /path/to/your/webroot
$ git clone git@github.com:cmsmadesimple/cmsmadesimple.git .        (1)
$ git checkout -b BR-45678                                          (2)
```
* The command (1) initializes the new local repository.
* The command (2) creates a new branch called `BR-45678` and switches to it.

## Suggesting Enhancements

Enhancement suggestions, [Feature Requests](https://dev.cmsmadesimple.org/feature_request/list/6), should be posted on the CMSMS Forge . Please provide:
- A clear use case for the enhancement
- How it benefits CMSMS users
- Any potential impacts on existing functionality
- Consideration for backward compatibility

### How to create a Feature Request Branch
Feature Request branches are usually created from the `master` branch. The feature will be included in a future/next release.
Your branch should be named `FR-12345` where `12345` is the number of the feature request in the [Forge](https://dev.cmsmadesimple.org/feature_request/list/6).

```git
$ cd /path/to/your/webroot
$ git clone git@github.com:cmsmadesimple/cmsmadesimple.git .        (1)
$ git checkout -b FR-12345                                          (2)
```
* The command (1) initializes the new local repository.
* The command (2) creates a new branch called `FR-12345` and switches to it.

## Pull Requests

Your changes should be made in the `FR-12345` branch and you are ready to submit a Pull Request upstream to CMSMS.

```git
$git pull --rebase upstream/master                     (1)
$git push --force                                      (2)
```	
* The command (1) will rebase your changes on top of the latest master branch.
* This will be the moment where you should resolve any conflicts.
* The command (2) will push upstream changes to your fork.

At this point, you can create a Pull Request on [Github](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) from your fork.
