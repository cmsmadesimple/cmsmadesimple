# CmsMadeSimple
CMS Made Simple is an Open Source Content Management System.
It's built using PHP and the Smarty Engine, which keeps content, functionality, and templates separated.

## We are on GITHUB 🎇
Finally, CMS Made Simple made it on Github.
As of the reading 🤞 of this document, the latest version is ![latest](https://badgen.net/github/release/cmsmadesimple/cmsmadesimple)

Please be patient with us as we are still learning how to use Github. To that regard, we welcome any suggestions through our [Slack Channel](https://www.cmsmadesimple.org/support/documentation/chat) mainly, as we are not yet opening issues on Github  
We thank you for your patience and understanding 😇.

## But we are still on our favorite forums and Slack Channel

While our presence on Github will move some of the discussions here, the [Forums](https://forum.cmsmadesimple.org/) and Slack are not going anywhere and will continue to serve their purpose 🫡.  
Over time, this will be further clarified and implemented, but the main idea is :

- Github for code (and soon related discussions and issues)
- Forums for discussions (as ever, that is our users' home 🏠)
- Slack for support (as a quick or not 🤦‍♂️ chat)
  
Don't forget our **forums provide help in multiple languages** so don't hesitate to [start there](https://forum.cmsmadesimple.org/viewforum.php?f=73).
